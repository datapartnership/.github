## About

The Development Data Partnership is a collaboration between international organizations and technology companies, facilitating the efficient and responsible use of third-party data in international development.

The Partnership’s success is predicated on our standardized legal, IT, and governance procedures, as well as our vibrant data science community.

Partnership activities are guided by a Board, with representation from each international development partner, as well as a Strategic Advisory Group, with representation from donors and technology partners. Day-to-day management is led by the Partnership’s Secretariat and working groups – legal, IT, and data science. These governance bodies – and the invaluable contributions of their members – make possible our seamless coordination between international organizations and private firms for public good.
